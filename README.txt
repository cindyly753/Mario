-Thought Process in Regards of the Project
--Modify the "Alien" file to only spawn at certain locations of the map in a grid
--Modify the "Ship" file to allow only left and right movements
	--Up is not increment needs to return to 0
	--If else statement? Increment to a certain point then decrement
	
	--Down needs to check if the block is being touched

--Landing Page and Music Modification Works
--Loop the Background instead of creating one map png
--Spawn the "Ship" at a certain coordinate and lock movement on KEYDOWN
